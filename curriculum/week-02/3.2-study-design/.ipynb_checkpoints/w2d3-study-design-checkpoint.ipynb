    ">We ran subjects in [chunks] and checked the effect along the way. It was something like 25 subjects run, then 10, then 7, then 5. Back then this did not seem like p-hacking. It seemed like saving money (assuming your effect size was big enough and p-value was the only issue).” Elsewhere, she notes that “The self-report [dependent variable about feelings of power] was p-hacked in that many different power questions and chosen were the ones that ‘worked.’”\n",
    "\n",
    "> Carney also highlights other problems with the way the experiments were run: For one thing, she writes, too many of the people involved were aware of the hypothesis being tested. Generally speaking, this is a bad idea, since this awareness can influence how an experiment is conducted, \n",

    "By default, Excel and other popular spreadsheet applications convert some gene symbols to dates and numbers. For example, instead of writing out “Membrane-Associated Ring Finger (C3HC4) 1, E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase,” researchers have dubbed the gene MARCH1. Excel converts this into a date—03/01/2016, say—because that’s probably what the majority of spreadsheet users mean when they type it into a cell. Similarly, gene identifiers like “2310009E13” are converted to exponential numbers (2.31E+19). In both cases, the conversions strip out valuable information about the genes in question."

The basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre-determined outcome. For a hypothesis to be termed a scientific hypothesis, **it has to be something that can be supported or refuted through carefully crafted experimentation or observation**. This is called falsifiability and testability, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. [Source](http://www.livescience.com/21490-what-is-a-scientific-hypothesis-definition-of-hypothesis.html)"
